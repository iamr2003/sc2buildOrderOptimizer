General: optimize sc2 builds to meet a specific objective

Kinds of objectives
- max of a certain unit
- max supply(maybe unit health or somethin)

Constraints
- certain amount of unit/structure at a certain time
- certain supply at a time
- uses a prechosen build at the front(to encode openers)
- can easily be stacked on top of each other

Output formats
- supply, and time for each decision

How to Optimize:
- branch and bound(oldest method)
- genetic algo(done before)
 - fitness is not too hard
 - genes are kind of hard
- there probably are ways to optimize penalizing over simplicity


Formats:
- easy way to change unit types/stats(probably text files)
- outputs readable in a variety of formats
